What is Graveyard Website..?</em></p>

Graveyard is the best place on the internet to look for burial and other final disposition information for your family,</br>
friends and famous people. The site provides tools that let people from all over the world work together, share information</br>
and build an online, virtual cemetery experience.</br></br>

At Graveyard youâ€™ll find details about cemeteries and individual memorials for many people buried in those cemeteries.</br>
Memorials generally include birth, death and burial information and may include pictures, biographies, family information</br>
and more. Members can contribute what they know and can leave remembrances via 'virtual flowers' on the memorials they visit,</br>
completing the virtual cemetery experience</br></br>

Our mission is to help people from all over the world work together to find, record and present final disposition </br>
information as a virtual cemetery experience.</br></br>

First and foremost, you are. Thousands of contributors submit new listings, updates, corrections, photographs and virtual </br>
flowers every hour. The site simply wouldn't exist without the million+ contributors. When it comes to administrating, </br>
building and maintaining the site, there are a handful of folks who work behind the scenes, helping out with Find A Grave </br>
on a daily basis.

<p>Our best team leader was born in Lahore but spent most of his youth in Karachi.</br>
	As a kid, when he wasn't solving the Rubik's cube with his feet or juggling fire,</br>
	He was figuring out how anything electronic worked. The arrival of the personal </br>
	computer brought a whole new outlet for Jim's nerdy tendencies. He now lives in </br>
	lahore his wife, children and three cats.</br></br>

	ALI Hassan & Jawad Ahmad created the graveyard website in 2015 because he could not find an existing site</br>
	that catered to his hobby of visiting the graves of famous people. He found that there</br>
 	are many thousands of folks around the world who share his interests. What began as an</br>
 	odd hobby became a livelihood and a passion. Building and seeing Find A Grave grow </br>
	beyond his wildest expectations has been immensely satisfying for Jim. Every day, </br>
	contributors from around the world enter new records, thousands use the site as an </br>
	educational reference tool, long-lost loved ones are located and millions of lives are </br>
	fondly remembered.
